					Hi! My name is Aisha Durrani, I am currently enrolled into Rutgers Coding Boot Camp.   I have been a banker for almost 8 years and recently decided to change careers into something I would like to do for the rest of my life.   I have held the Securities Licenses, which are the Series 6, Series 63 and Life Accident and Health, all which seemed very difficult to do in the beginning but soon enough became a second nature. I look forward to saying I love web development one day :).
					<br>
					<br> 
					 One thing I am most passionate about is Art; I love painting and creating art pieces.  I also love to travel; just recently I came back from a 4-city trip that included London England, Basel Switzerland Munich Germany and Istanbul Turkey.    London is like a second home to me because 2 of my best friends live there.   The have also traveled to Amsterdam in the past I think its the most beautiful city in Europe, its full of culture and has a unique vibe    
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 Oh yeah and I have a cat, he is a Tuxedo and his name is Sylvester.
